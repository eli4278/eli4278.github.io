## Data Science Projects

### [ATP Professional Tennis Data Science Tutorial](https://github.com/eli4278/eli/blob/main/ATP_Data_Analysis.ipynb){:target="_blank"}

In this project, I analyzed data from the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) in order to determine if certain physical attributes such as height and left-handedness are significant advantages on the ATP Tour. Models that I tried include linear regression and hypothesis testing.

### [BMI Classification](https://github.com/eli4278/eli/blob/main/sleep_health.ipynb){:target="_blank"}

I experimented with three classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM) in order to predict the the BMI category of an individual based on health attributes such as physical activity level, sleep quality, and blood pressure. This project provided valuable insights into the training time vs. accuracy tradeoff.

### [Gapminder Data Visualization](https://github.com/eli4278/eli/blob/main/gapminder.ipynb){:target="_blank"}

With life expectancy data from gapminder.org, I employed advanced statistical techniques such as generalized linear models and residuals analysis in order to discover trends and differences in life expectancy between different continents.

### [Moneyball Analysis](https://github.com/eli4278/eli/blob/main/moneyball.ipynb){:target="_blank"}

Inspired by the movie MoneyBall, I analyzed performance and spending data from the MLB to see whether or not the the Oakland A's really performed better than other teams while spending less money. The data used was first extracted from an SQL database and cleaned using queries.

### [Pokemon Type Classification](https://github.com/eli4278/eli/blob/main/pokemon.ipynb){:target="_blank"}

I experimented with different classification models such as Decision Trees and kNN in order to predict a Pokemon's primary type based on its combat attributes.

### [Solar Flare EDA](https://github.com/eli4278/eli/blob/main/solar_flares.ipynb){:target="_blank"}

Using the BeautifulSoup package in Python, I webscraped solar flare data from different sources using the BeautifulSoup package in python in order to corroborate the information and see whether or not different sources agree with each other.

### [Sewage Overflow Map](https://nbviewer.org/github/eli4278/eli/blob/main/sewage.ipynb){:target="_blank"}

I created an interactive map in order to visualize sewage overflow data in Maryland and their different causes. -->
