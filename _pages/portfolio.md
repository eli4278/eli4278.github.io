## Data Science Projects

### [ATP Professional Tennis Data Science Tutorial](https://github.com/eli4278/eli/blob/main/ATP_Data_Analysis.ipynb){:target="_blank"}

In this project, I analyzed data from the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) in order to determine if certain physical attributes such as height and left-handedness are significant advantages on the ATP Tour. Models that I tried include linear regression and hypothesis testing.

### [Moneyball Analysis](https://github.com/eli4278/eli/blob/main/moneyball.ipynb){:target="_blank"}

Inspired by the movie MoneyBall, I analyzed performance and spending data from the MLB to see whether or not the the Oakland A's really performed better than other teams while spending less money. The data used was first extracted from an SQL database and cleaned using queries.

### [Solar Flare EDA](https://github.com/eli4278/eli/blob/main/solar_flares.ipynb){:target="_blank"}

I webscraped solar flare data from different sources using the BeautifulSoup package in python in order to corroborate the information and see whether or not different sources agree with each other.

### [Gapminder Data Visualization](https://github.com/eli4278/eli/blob/main/gapminder.ipynb){:target="_blank"}

Using life expectancy data from gapminder.org, I experimented with statistical models such as generalized linear models and applied visualization techniques to find trends and differences in life expectancy between different parts of the world.
