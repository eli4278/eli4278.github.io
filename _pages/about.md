## Introduction

My name is Eric Li and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland - College Park studying Statistics and Data Science. Currently I plan to graduate in May 2024, and I am interested in finding a data science job after graduation. Through this website, I hope to showcase my data analysis skills, and present a comprehensive overview of my professional aspirations.
