## Introduction

My name is Eric Li and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland - College Park studying Statistics and Data Science. Currently, I plan to graduate in May 2024, and am interested in pursuing a career involving data analysis. I created this website in order to showcase my technical skills, and present a comprehensive overview of my professional experience.
